<p><b>FISTA</b> - Fast InfoSet Translator and Attacker</p>

<p>This extension converts incoming Fast Infoset requests and responses to XML, and converts outgoing messages back to Fast Infoset.
This allows messages to be analyzed within Burp, and use of Burp tools including Repeater, Intruder and Scanner.
The client and server are unaware of the translation and function as normal.</p>
